At first, he thought he was in love with Haskell, for he could program in it every day without feeling bored. But later, some dark currents flowing under the seemingly blissful moments began to evade his senses, unfothomable fear of losing his authentic Self floating on the lake of the Heart, mocking at his conformity and self-deception. At the same time, a strong force was pulling him unto a different state of being, and this force was not coming from the outer world but always running in his own veins, waiting their voices to be heard. This is a yearning towards Beauty, and ultimately Freedom. 

He began to remember why he fell in love with Haskell in the first place. It was not beacause of its efficency or practicality (if this programming language really possesses such qualities), but its elegance and those ideas behind such subtle constructions. And he actually found it kind of contemptible that people nowadays were worshiping a newly-born god called technology more than any other eras before. This "god" is nothing but the modern progeny of Urizen, thus knowing best about how to bring more probable slavery into this world. 

After realizing his wrong passion towards the modren god called technology, the imprisonment of souls brought by it, and the fetters built upon the so called selected "career path", he decided to leave for once and for all. And this was the begining of his rebellion. 

"Be a poet or nothing at all", he murmured to himself, but the echoes inside his soul were more exciting than the rolling thunders, declaring the war towards any form of oppression and depression, reclaiming the path towards liberty and love.

Thus began his journey.

The story unfolds.
